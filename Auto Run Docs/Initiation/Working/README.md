# Working Directory

**Purpose**: Temporary workspace for Auto Run execution - stores logs, notes, and intermediate files.

This directory contains all artifacts generated during the Auto Run Initiation phases, including:

- Environment verification results
- Architecture analysis documents
- Test results and validation reports
- Performance metrics and benchmarks
- Configuration documentation
- Developer guides and references

## Document Format

All documents follow structured Markdown format with:
- YAML front matter for metadata
- Wiki-link cross-references (`[[Document-Name]]`)
- Consistent tagging for DocGraph exploration

## Usage

- **Auto Run Agents**: Write phase deliverables here
- **Human Developers**: Reference these docs for project knowledge
- **Knowledge Tools**: Parse wiki-links for graph exploration (e.g., Obsidian)
